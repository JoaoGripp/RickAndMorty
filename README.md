In this series, I will learn how to build a full featured iOS app in Swift and Xcode.
I will be using both UIKit and SwiftUI to help you gain a better understanding of the tools and technologies available.
I'll integrate a real world API, leverage source control, add unit tests, and much more.
By the end of this series, I'll know how to build a well architected iOS app, test, and even publish it on the app store for the world to see.

This series is meant for beginners with prior base knowledge of iOS and the Swift programming language.
